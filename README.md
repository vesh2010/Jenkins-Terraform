# Jenkins-Terraform
ci/cd using jenkins and terraform 
1. CI/CD Overview
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a shared project and then deploys them to production in an automated fashion. Using tools like Terraform, AWS, and Jenkins, you can create a scalable, automated pipeline that enhances development efficiency and reduces human error.

2. Terraform
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. With Terraform, you can build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.

Key Concepts:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Allows you to define infrastructure in configuration files, making it easy to automate the deployment and management of resources.
Providers: Plugins used by Terraform to interact with external APIs (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). For AWS, the provider allows Terraform to interact with AWS services like EC2, S3, Lambda, etc.
State Management: Terraform maintains the state of the resources it manages. The state helps it understand what infrastructure has been provisioned.
Modules: A module is a container for multiple resources that are used together. It allows you to organize and reuse code across different environments.
Usage in CI/CD:
Terraform Code Versioning: Store your Terraform configuration files in a version control system (e.g., Git), ensuring consistency across environments.
Automated Infrastructure Deployment: With a CI/CD pipeline, Terraform is used to automatically provision and manage cloud resources (AWS infrastructure) as part of the deployment process.
Execution Workflow:
terraform init: Initializes the working directory.
terraform plan: Previews changes.
terraform apply: Provisions infrastructure.
terraform destroy: Tears down infrastructure when no longer needed.
3. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
AWS is the world's most comprehensive cloud platform offering a wide range of services like compute, storage, networking, machine learning, and security.

Key AWS Services in CI/CD:
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Scalable virtual machines used to run applications.
S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage used for backups, static websites, and code artifact storage.
RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed databases, useful for backend storage.
Lambda: Serverless compute service that automatically scales.
IAM (Identity and Access Management): Provides fine-grained access control to AWS resources, crucial for managing security in your CI/CD pipeline.
Usage in CI/CD:
Environment Provisioning: Terraform provisions and manages AWS services like EC2, S3, or Lambda as part of the deployment.
Artifact Storage: Store build artifacts (e.g., code packages, Docker images) in S3, ECR (Elastic Container Registry), or CodeArtifact.
AWS Lambda Functions: These can be used in serverless environments to trigger specific actions during the CI/CD process.
IAM Policies: Secure your infrastructure and control access rights across different stages of the CI/CD pipeline.
4. Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates continuous integration and continuous deployment. It helps developers integrate code into a shared repository multiple times a day.

Key Concepts:
Jobs and Pipelines: Jenkins executes a series of steps defined in jobs or pipelines (using Jenkinsfiles).
Jenkinsfile: A text file that contains the pipeline as code. It defines the stages of a CI/CD pipeline (build, test, deploy).
Plugins: Jenkins has a robust ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality. For example, there are plugins for Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GitHub, and more.
Master-Agent Architecture: The Jenkins master coordinates tasks while agents execute them on distributed machines, improving scalability.
Usage in CI/CD:
Automated Builds: Jenkins can pull code from repositories (like GitHub or GitLab), build the project, run tests, and deploy artifacts to AWS.
Pipeline as Code: Define the entire pipeline using a Jenkinsfile. This file automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code.
Integration with Terraform and AWS: Jenkins can trigger Terraform commands to provision infrastructure on AWS and deploy the application.
Notification System: Jenkins can send build notifications through email, Slack, or other communication tools to notify developers of build status.
